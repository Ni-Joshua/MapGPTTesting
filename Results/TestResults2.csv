The map depicts the area around the city of Medina in western Saudi Arabia, including part of the Red Sea coast to the west and inland desert/plateau regions to the east. Notable features on the sheet include the coastal plain by the Red Sea, higher terrain (mountains and wadis) running roughly parallel to the coast, and numerous place‐names associated with Medina and surrounding towns.  Hence, a good approximation for the bounding box in “top‐left” to “bottom‐right” order (longitude, latitude) is:  • Top left:  (36 ° E, 28 ° N)   • Bottom right: (40 ° E, 24 ° N)  Reasoning:   • The vertical lines labeled 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 degrees E mark the map’s western and eastern edges.   • The horizontal lines labeled 24 through 28 degrees N mark the southern and northern extents.   • Medina itself sits centrally within those lat/long bounds, corroborating that 36 ° E to 40 ° E and 24 ° N to 28 ° N is the correct box.","ENVELOPE(35.0, 42.0, 28.0, 24.0)"

The large gray area at left is Berlin itself; the extensive green areas to the right (east) are forests and wetlands, interspersed with lakes (e.g.\ around the Spree and Dahme Rivers) and smaller towns.  Although the map’s exact graticule is not fully legible in the scan, one can infer (by known reference points such as central Berlin near 52.52 N, 13.40 E and the extent of forest and lakes southeast toward roughly 52 N, 14+ E) that it spans roughly one degree of latitude by about 1.3–1.4 degrees of longitude.

In broad terms, it is the Leipzig region of central Germany, bounded on the north/northeast by the Düben Heath (Dübener Heide) and on the south by the area just below Leipzig.  From inspection of the roads, rivers (notably the Mulde), and forested areas, one can infer that the sheet spans roughly on the order of 0.5–0.7 degrees in latitude and about 1.2–1.3 degrees in longitude.    A reasonable modern bounding‐box estimate (in decimal degrees, longitude then latitude) that captures the “top‐left” to “bottom‐right” extents is approximately:  • Top‐left corner:     Longitude ≈ 11.8 E     Latitude  ≈ 51.7 N    • Bottom‐right corner:     Longitude ≈ 13.1 E     Latitude  ≈ 51.0 N    RATIONALE:    • Leipzig (≈ 51.34 N, 12.38 E) appears in the lower‐left portion, so the map must extend a bit farther south and west than that.    • Torgau (≈ 51.56 N, 12.99 E) lies near the upper‐right edge, implying the sheet reaches to at least ≈ 51.6 N and ≈ 13 E.    • The large forested block in the north corresponds to the Dübener Heide (centered roughly near 51.6–51.7 N).    • Comparing map scale and coverage suggests a vertical span of roughly 0.6–0.7 degrees of latitude and a horizontal span of 1.2–1.3 degrees of longitude, hence the corners at about (11.8 E, 51.7 N) and (13.1 E, 51.0 N).    If more precise war‐era grid data were available, one could refine these further; in their absence, the above represents a solid “best‐fit” modern bounding box for the 1944 War Office 1 : 100 000 “Leipzig” sheet.","ENVELOPE(12.33333, 13.33333, 51.75, 51.25)"

From the grid‐lines and marginal ticks visible on the scan (and knowing the typical coverage for 1 : 250 000 AMS sheets of Burma), one can deduce that the chart extends approximately two degrees in latitude (from about 20 ° 30′ N up to around 22 ° 30′ N) and about one‐and‐a‐half degrees in longitude (from roughly 95 ° 30′ E over to near 97 ° 00′ E).

Pecan,” “E. Chaffin,” “E. Houston,” “N. Throckmorton,” “N. Maxey,” “N. Willow”) and the “Sherman” label at the top, this Sanborn‐style map is of a small set of blocks in the city of Sherman, Texas (Grayson County). These north–south and east–west streets exist just east of downtown Sherman, roughly bounded (today) by E. Mulberry Street to the north, E. Houston Street to the south, N. Throckmorton Street to the west, and N. Willow Street to the east.  Points of Interest in the Image:  • Each of the yellow building footprints represents individual structures on those blocks.   • Streets are clearly labeled (E. Mulberry, E. Pecan, E. Chaffin, E. Houston, N. Throckmorton, N. Maxey, N. Willow).   • There are a couple of larger colored blocks (pink/blue) that likely denote institutions or notable buildings (e.g., churches, schools, or civic buildings).    Approximate Bounding Box Coordinates:  A suitable modern bounding box that captures just those four blocks can be approximated by the following corners (in “(longitude, latitude)” format):  Top‐Left (NW) Corner:  (–96.6140,  33.6370)   Bottom‐Right (SE) Corner: (–96.6100,  33.6330)    These coordinates reflect the westernmost/northernmost and easternmost/southernmost extents of the mapped blocks in Sherman, Texas, based on matching today’s street layout to the historic plan.

The north–south streets visible include Chapman (on the far left/west), Blanton (near the center), and Sears (on the far right/east).  The major east–west streets include Elm (across the top), Locust and Walnut (through the middle), and Grand Avenue (at the bottom).  A small creek is drawn meandering roughly top‐right to center.  Several structures are labeled (such as the Christian College inset in pink at the top) along with individual building footprints in yellow and pink, typical of Sanborn Fire Insurance maps.    Notable points of interest one can see on the map include:   • The “Christian College” complex at the north edge (shown in the pink inset).   • A “Public School” or “Pacific College” label in the block just south of Locust.   • Numerous residences and a few commercial or institutional buildings (often drawn in pink).   • Major through‐streets: Elm, Locust, Walnut, and Grand, with block numbers indicated (e.g., 27, 28, 34, 35).    While this is a historical map, the modern layout of Whitewright still preserves many of these street names.  One can approximate the bounding box by looking up the intersections at the northwest (Chapman & Elm) and southeast (Sears & Grand).    ---  **Bounding Box Coordinates**    Below is a reasonable “best‐guess” bounding box in modern coordinates (WGS84), enclosing from Chapman at Elm in the top‐left (NW corner) down to Sears at Grand in the bottom‐right (SE corner).    1. **Top‐Left (NW Corner):**      Longitude ≈ –96.399°      Latitude  ≈  33.515°    2. **Bottom‐Right (SE Corner):**      Longitude ≈ –96.389°      Latitude  ≈  33.508°    Rationally, the map covers only a few blocks, so the coordinate differences are on the order of a few hundred meters in each direction.

Railroad Av.,” “S. Railroad Av.,” etc.) and the label “Giddings, Tex.” at the upper right, this appears to be an historic Sanborn‐style fire‐insurance or property map of downtown Giddings, Texas. The layout focuses on several blocks around the railroad tracks, which run roughly east–west through the center of town, and includes the areas around Caldwell Street (US 290) and Main Street (US 77).   Points of interest shown on the map include:   • The railroad right‐of‐way, with North and South Railroad Avenue running on either side.   • Key downtown blocks, each subdivided into numbered lots with buildings shown in colored footprints.   • Major named streets (Caldwell, Main, Hempstead, Williamson, Burleson, Austin, Richmond) indicating the core of Giddings’ historic business district.   • A small watercourse meandering near the top‐left portion of the map (likely a creek in or near Giddings).    Because this is an older map focused on just a few central blocks, the best we can do is approximate a bounding box around the main downtown area of Giddings near the railroad. Modern coordinates for that several‐block area lie roughly between about −96.940 ° longitude (west) and −96.935 ° longitude (east), and between about 30.184 ° latitude (north) and 30.179 ° latitude (south).    **Bounding Box Coordinates (approx.)**    - **Top‐Left (NW) corner**:     Longitude: −96.940°     Latitude:  30.184°    - **Bottom‐Right (SE) corner**:     Longitude: −96.935°     Latitude:  30.179°    **Reasoning**   1. The sheet plainly labels Giddings, Texas, and shows its central downtown blocks.   2. Modern Giddings sits at roughly 30.18 ° N, 96.94 ° W, so the map’s content corresponds to a tight cluster of blocks about a few hundred meters to either side of the railroad/US 290/US 77 intersection.   3.

One street labeled “Broadway” also appears prominently.  Taken together, these clues strongly suggest it is a late‐19th‐ or early‐20th‐century map of downtown **Dickinson, North Dakota**, where “Broadway” is a main north–south thoroughfare.  The map shows a dense arrangement of rectangular blocks, each subdivided into lots and with building footprints in yellow.  A compass rose occupies an intersection near the center.  Typical “points of interest” on such a fire‐insurance map would be civic buildings (e.g.\ a courthouse), hotels, banks, churches, or any large structures labeled for insurance or fire‐risk purposes—but these building labels are only partially legible in the scan.  Likely candidates would include a courthouse or city hall near Broadway, but exact names or signage are not fully visible.  Because the actual scan does not pin down precise modern street coordinates and because georeferencing early insurance maps often requires matching street names to present‐day city GIS data, we must make an educated approximation of the bounding box.  Downtown Dickinson today lies near 46.88 °N, –102.79 °W.  A few central blocks around Broadway might span roughly 0.004–0.005 degrees of latitude and longitude (a few city blocks in each direction).  ---  **Approximate Bounding‐Box Coordinates**  • **Top‐left (NW) corner**:     Latitude ≈ 46.885 °N     Longitude ≈ –102.794 °E    • **Bottom‐right (SE) corner**:     Latitude ≈ 46.881 °N     Longitude ≈ –102.788 °E    These coordinates place a rectangle of a few downtown blocks in Dickinson, ND, consistent with the layout shown on the historical map.

The compass rose and block numbering are also consistent with that style of map. Despite these clues, there is no definitive indicator on the sheet that pins it unambiguously to a known city or set of exact coordinates.   In other words, while we can say confidently that it is a plan of (likely) a few blocks in an American city, the image itself does not provide enough information (such as a city name or cross‐reference to a known grid) to tie it to an exact spot on Earth. The Dolph Briscoe Center at UT Austin holds historical maps from many Texas towns (and beyond), but “Mariposa,” “Harrison,” “Hazel,” etc. are all fairly common street names in multiple regions of the Southwest and elsewhere in the United States.  **What the Map Shows**  • A rectangular grid of five city blocks running north–south (streets labeled MARIPOSA Av., OAKLAND Av., and EWING).   • Five east–west streets from top to bottom (LONG Av., HARRISON, AVERILL Av., “OR HAZEL Av.,” and NORTH).   • Numbered lots or parcels in each block (in yellow).   • A standardized scale in feet, typical of older fire‐insurance maps.    **Likely Bounding Box**  Because the original cannot be tied to an exact modern location from the image alone, the best one can do is:  1. Identify the corners of the map as the intersection of (Mariposa Av., Long Av.) at top‐left and (Ewing Av., North) at bottom‐right.   2. Acknowledge that we do not know with certainty where on Earth this set of streets actually sits.    Hence, **an “educated guess”** must suffice. We know it is almost certainly in the continental US, likely in the Southwest or Texas (given the Spanish‐derived “Mariposa” and the Briscoe Center provenance). A typical city block is on the order of 200–300 feet on a side, which in latitude/longitude terms is only a few thousandths of a degree.  Below is an example bounding‐box guess, placing these blocks in southern Texas (near Laredo) at a plausible scale for a few city blocks.  This is purely illustrative:  - **Top‐Left (Mariposa × Long)**:     Latitude ≈ 27.5071 ° N     Longitude ≈ −99.5071 ° W    - **Bottom‐Right (Ewing × North)**:     Latitude ≈ 27.5065 ° N     Longitude ≈ −99.5065 ° W    (In reality, without further reference data, we cannot be sure of the exact location, only that the map depicts several contiguous blocks in a US town or city.)    **Conclusion**  Because the map has no unique city identifier or modern coordinate tie‐in, **there is not enough information to determine the true bounding‐box coordinates**. The illustration above (27.5071 N, −99.5071 W to 27.5065 N, −99.5065 W) shows how one might “guess” a roughly one‐block bounding box if forced to supply lat–long.

The major cities and features called out (such as San Salvador, Santa Ana, and La Union) are arranged in their characteristic positions around the country. El Salvador’s latitude ranges roughly from a little over 13° N to about 14.5° N, and its longitude ranges from roughly –90.1° W on its western border with Guatemala to about –87.7° W on its eastern border near the Gulf of Fonseca.  Key Points of Interest: • San Salvador (the capital, near the center of the country).   • Santa Ana (to the northwest).   • San Miguel (to the east).   • La Libertad (southwest coastal area).   • Sensuntepeque and La Palma (northern departments).  Bounding Box Coordinates:  Because the request is specifically for the top‐left (northwest) and bottom‐right (southeast) corners of the bounding box (in longitude, latitude format) and the map depicts the entirety of El Salvador, a reasonable approximate bounding box is:  • Top‐Left (NW corner):     Longitude: –90.13°, Latitude: 14.45°      • Bottom‐Right (SE corner):     Longitude: –87.69°, Latitude: 13.16°    Reasoning:  El Salvador’s territory fits within those limits, which capture the westernmost border near –90.13° W and the easternmost border near –87.69° W, while the northern boundary reaches about 14.45° N and the southern boundary extends to about 13.16° N.
