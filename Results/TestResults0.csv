Please locate the top left and bottom right longitude and latitude coordinates of the provided location's bounding box. The longitude values should range from -180 degrees to 180 degrees and the latitude values should range from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Please provide reasoning for your response,"A convenient way to see this on the scanned sheet is that it is bounded by (approximately) 36 °E to 42 °E in longitude and 24 °N to 28 °N in latitude.  In “top‐left/lower‐right” form (longitude, latitude):  • Top‐left:  (36 °E, 28 °N)   • Bottom‐right: (42 °E, 24 °N)  Reasoning (in broad terms):   1.  The map is centered on the Medina region (around 24.5 °N, 39.6 °E) and extends westward to the Red Sea and eastward well into the interior.   2.  The graticule (grid) visible at the edges shows roughly four degrees of latitude (24 °N to 28 °N) and six degrees of longitude (36 °E out to roughly 42 °E).   3.  From inspection of the labeled latitude parallels and longitude meridians along the map’s neat‐lines, 24 °N–28 °N by 36 °E–42 °E fits the outermost bounding box.","ENVELOPE(35.0, 42.0, 28.0, 24.0)"

The longitude values should range from -180 degrees to 180 degrees and the latitude values should range from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Please provide reasoning for your response,"A convenient way to see why the sheet spans roughly those corners is to note that central Berlin (about 52.52 N, 13.4 E) lies well left‐of‐center on the map, and the coverage extends north of 52.5 N and well east past 14 E.  By comparing known towns/lakes at the edges (for example, areas near Nauen in the NW, the Dahme–Spree lake region in the south, and Fürstenwalde in the east at roughly 14 E), one can bracket the sheet to roughly the following “neat‐line” corners in (longitude, latitude):  • Top‐left (NW):  (12.9 E, 52.7 N)   • Bottom‐right (SE): (14.4 E, 52.0 N)  Those coordinates capture the westernmost and northernmost map features (around 12.9 E and 52.7 N), down to the southeastern extent near 14.4 E and 52.0 N. This box comfortably encloses the entire printed sheet as shown.","ENVELOPE(13.3333, 14.3333, 52.75, 52.25)"

Please locate the top left and bottom right longitude and latitude coordinates of the provided location's bounding box. The longitude values should range from -180 degrees to 180 degrees and the latitude values should range from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Please provide reasoning for your response,"A convenient way to see this is that the Second World War “Central Europe 1 : 100 000” sheets were generally laid out on half‐degree by one‐degree blocks of latitude/longitude.  The “Leipzig” sheet is bounded (approximately) between 51 ° 15′ N and 51 ° 45′ N (i.e.\ 51.25 N to 51.75 N in decimal) and between 12 ° E and 13 ° E.    Hence the top‐left corner (lat / lon) is about    • (51.75 N, 12.00 E)  and the bottom‐right corner is about    • (51.25 N, 13.00 E).  Those values follow directly from the standard half‐degree‐by‐one‐degree map coverage convention used in that series and match the latitude band and longitude range shown along the map’s neatlines.","ENVELOPE(12.33333, 13.33333, 51.75, 51.25)"

The longitude values should range from -180 degrees to 180 degrees and the latitude values should range from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Please provide reasoning for your response,"A convenient way to see that this sheet is the standard one‐degree‐by‐one‐degree “Yamethin” 1 : 250 000 topographic map is by noting that Yamethin (near 20.4 N, 96.1 E) sits roughly central to the sheet and that such AMS/Survey of India sheets typically span one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude.  From the graticule (the lat–long grid) along the map’s neatlines, one sees that it runs from 20° 30′ N up to 21° 30′ N, and from 95° 30′ E over to 96° 30′ E.    Converted to decimal degrees:  • Top‐left (NW) corner:  (21.5 N, 95.5 E)   • Bottom‐right (SE) corner:  (20.5 N, 96.5 E)    Hence, the bounding box is approximately   NW = (21.5, 95.5) , SE = (20.5, 96.5).","ENVELOPE(95.99988, 97.5002, 21.00021, 19.99977)"

By recognizing the outline and place‐names (e.g., San Salvador, Santa Ana, San Miguel) it is clear the map is of El Salvador.   2. El Salvador lies roughly between 13.1 °N and 14.5 °N in latitude and between –87.7 °W and –90.1 °W in longitude.   3.

In modern decimal coordinates (longitude, latitude), a good approximation to the upper‐left (northwest) corner is    ( –96.6110 ,  33.6380 )  and the lower‐right (southeast) corner is approximately    ( –96.5990 ,  33.6320 ).  These coordinates come from matching the named streets (N. Throckmorton, N. Maxey, N. Willow, E. Mulberry, E. Pecan, E. Chaffin, and E. Houston) to their present‐day intersections in Sherman, then reading off the resulting lat/long box in standard GIS sources. The “top‐left” longitude is more westerly (thus more negative) and latitude is slightly higher, while the “bottom‐right” longitude is less negative (further east) and the latitude is a little lower, which is consistent with how bounding‐box corners are typically reported.","ENVELOPE(-96.60281029865446,-96.59826467758317,33.64213837817811,33.637663330009644)"

As with most historical Sanborn maps, some street names and alignments may have changed slightly over the decades, so these coordinates are necessarily approximate:  • Top‐left (NW) corner:  33.5141 N,  −96.3953 W   • Bottom‐right (SE) corner:  33.5106 N,  −96.3886 W    REASONING   1.

Modern online maps show these same street names arranged in a compact grid southwest of Whitewright’s current town center.   3.

Please provide reasoning for your response,"Below is a reasonable approximation for the bounding‐box corners in modern WGS84 coordinates for the downtown Giddings blocks shown on the map (centered on Caldwell St, Main St, and the north/south Railroad Avenues):  • Top‐left (northwest) corner:     Latitude ≈ 30.1840 °N     Longitude ≈ −96.9410 °E    • Bottom‐right (southeast) corner:     Latitude ≈ 30.1800 °N     Longitude ≈ −96.9350 °E    REASONING   1. The map titles (“Giddings, Tex.”) and labels (Caldwell St, Main St, Williamson, etc.) indicate the downtown core of Giddings, Texas.   2. Matching modern street names and the railroad alignment in Giddings places this cluster of blocks just south of the rail line that crosses US 77 (Caldwell St).   3. By identifying the main north–south and east–west streets visible on the historical map and correlating them with current roads in Giddings, one can estimate a bounding box that covers the same set of blocks.

Street labels like “Dickinson St.” (or similar) appear in many U.S. towns and cities, and the overall grid layout could match a number of places. In other words, the map itself does not provide clear, unique geographic markers (such as names of well‐known landmarks or an unambiguous city name) that would let one conclusively tie it to a specific set of latitude–longitude bounds.  Because of that, I can’t reliably give top‐left and bottom‐right coordinates in the usual −180 to 180 (longitude) / −90 to 90 (latitude) system. If there were a clearly identifiable feature—say, the name of the city or a recognizable landmark—one could cross‐reference that information with modern mapping to derive a bounding box.
