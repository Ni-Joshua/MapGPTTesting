Please locate the top left and bottom right longitude and latitude coordinates of the provided location's bounding box. The longitude values should range from -180 degrees to 180 degrees and the latitude values should range from -90 degrees to 90 degrees. Please provide reasoning for your response and provide an educated guess if there is not enough information to deduce a response.,"A convenient way to see why the sheet spans approximately 37–41 °E in longitude and 24–28 °N in latitude is that “Medina (North G–37)” is a standard 1 : 1 000 000 War Office series sheet covering the region around 24–28 °N and 37–41 °E.  Medina itself (near 24.5 °N, 39.6 °E) lies roughly in the middle.    Hence, the best estimate for the corners of the map’s bounding box is:    • Top‐left: 28 ° N, 37 ° E   • Bottom‐right: 24 ° N, 41 ° E    (This follows the typical 4° × 4° coverage of that sheet in the eastern Arabian Peninsula, with the “top‐left” corner the northwestern extremity and the “bottom‐right” corner the southeastern extremity.)","ENVELOPE(35.0, 42.0, 28.0, 24.0)"

Although the exact graticule is difficult to read at this scan‐size, one can infer on the order of 0.5–0.6 degrees of latitude coverage (≈ 50–60 km) by about 1.0–1.3 degrees of longitude coverage (≈ 70–90 km).   A reasonable “best‐fit” bounding box in standard lat–long (WGS84‐like) notation would therefore be approximately:  • Top‐left: 52.70 N, 13.00 E   • Bottom‐right: 52.10 N, 14.30 E    Those corners place Berlin’s center left‐of‐center on the sheet and include the cluster of lakes and forests seen in the southeast. Since the map’s margin ticks are not clearly legible, these coordinates are necessarily an educated estimate rather than an exact reading.","ENVELOPE(13.3333, 14.3333, 52.75, 52.25)"

Please provide reasoning for your response and provide an educated guess if there is not enough information to deduce a response.,"A convenient way to see that this sheet is centered on the Leipzig / Halle area in eastern Germany is by noting the major cities and rivers shown (Leipzig in the south‐center, Halle at lower left, the Mulde and Saale rivers, etc.). Although the exact graticule is difficult to read from the scan, the standard 1 : 100 000 War Office “Central Europe” sheets typically spanned on the order of 0.5–0.8 degrees of latitude by about 1 degree of longitude.    From the landmarks and approximate scales, a reasonable “best guess” bounding box is:  • Top‐left corner (latitude ≈ 51.8 N, longitude ≈ 11.7 E)   • Bottom‐right corner (latitude ≈ 51.0 N, longitude ≈ 13.0 E)    In other words, the map covers roughly from 51 degrees N up to about 51 degrees 48 minutes N, and from about 11 degrees 42 minutes E over to nearly 13 degrees E. Because the scan offers only partial graticule detail, these coordinates are necessarily approximate, but they capture the main extent of the sheet around Leipzig.","ENVELOPE(12.33333, 13.33333, 51.75, 51.25)"

Yamethin, near 20.4 N / 96.1 E, lies roughly central to that box. Accordingly, the NW (top‐left) corner is at 95° 30′ E, 21° 30′ N and the SE (bottom‐right) corner at 96° 30′ E, 20° 30′ N.

Houston,” “N. Throckmorton,” “N. Maxey,” and “N. Willow”) and the “Sherman” label, this appears to be an old Sanborn‐type fire‐insurance map of a few downtown blocks in Sherman, Texas. A reasonable modern bounding box for those four or five blocks is approximately:  • Top‐left (NW) corner:  33.6405 N, ‑96.6130 W   • Bottom‐right (SE) corner: 33.6345 N, ‑96.6060 W    These corners simply bracket the set of streets shown (Mulberry in the north through Houston in the south, Throckmorton on the west through Willow on the east).

The map’s street grid (Elm at the north, Grand Avenue at the south, Chapman to the west, Sears to the east) corresponds to several blocks in present‐day downtown Whitewright.   2. Matching intersection points (e.g., Elm & Chapman, Grand & Sears) on current maps yields these approximate lat/long corners.   3. Because the source is an early‐1900s Sanborn map, the precise georeferencing can only be done by best‐fit alignment with modern street layouts, so the above coordinates are estimates rather than survey‐exact.","ENVELOPE(-96.39739674565065,-96.39367175729356,33.51622300635808,33.51245144377557)"

A practical way to bound that several‐block area (from roughly Caldwell Street on the west to Main Street on the east, and from the railroad right‐of‐way on the north down to Richmond Street on the south) is approximately:   • Top‐left (NW) corner:  30.1838 N, –96.9438 W    • Bottom‐right (SE) corner: 30.1810 N, –96.9370 W    These coordinates enclose the streets visible on the map.

Sanborn sheets were published by the Library of Congress, which further aligns with the watermark.  Without modern reference points it is impossible to pinpoint the exact block edges, but one can reasonably approximate the downtown Dickinson bounding box around:  • Top‐left (NW) corner:  ≈ 46.886 N,  −102.792 W   • Bottom‐right (SE) corner:  ≈ 46.880 N,  −102.782 W    Those coordinates (about 0.006° of latitude by 0.010° of longitude) correspond to only a few downtown blocks, consistent with the size of a typical Sanborn map sheet.

Please provide reasoning for your response and provide an educated guess if there is not enough information to deduce a response.,"After examining the street names (“Long Av,” “Harrison,” “Mariposa,” “Averill,” “Hazel,” “Oakland,” “Ewing,” and “North”) and the general layout, there is simply not enough locational detail (such as a city name, highway marker, or other unique reference) to tie this Sanborn‐style map snippet to a precise spot on the globe. Many U.S. towns have a “Harrison” or “North” Street, and “Mariposa” is common in the Southwest, but none of the labels shown here unambiguously identifies a single city or neighborhood.    Because we lack a definitive way to pinpoint these blocks, the best an “expert geolocator” can do here is acknowledge that the information is insufficient.  If forced to guess, one might note the Spanish name “Mariposa,” suggestive of the U.S. Southwest (possibly Texas or California), but no combination of these street names is unique enough to yield a certain match.    Consequently, I cannot provide a reliable bounding‐box latitude/longitude.  An “educated guess” would be purely speculative.  In other words, from the scan alone, we cannot narrow it down any better than saying “somewhere in the continental United States,” which corresponds to a bounding box of roughly:  • Top‐left:  Latitude 49° N,  Longitude −125° W   • Bottom‐right: Latitude 25° N, Longitude −66° W    But this is merely the broad U.S. rectangle.
