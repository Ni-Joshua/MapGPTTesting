The map provided is labeled ""Yonofere"" and is part of a map series of French West Africa (""FRENCH WEST AFRICA""), which helps to narrow down the geographical region.  Below the map's gridline, there is a scale and other markers that delineate longitude and latitude intervals.  Reasoning: - Most topographical maps use a systematic grid which allows us to deduce the coordinates using intervals. - This map focuses on a specific region within French West Africa and provides necessary grid lines and numerical markers to estimate the bounding box.  By examining the grid lines and their associated numbers and correspondingly spatial relate it on a global coordinate scale: - The left and right vertical grid lines represent longitude. - The top and bottom horizontal grid lines represent latitude.  The exact coordinates for this map would require precise calibrations from these lines. Given the traditional map sectioning system, here is the educated guess for this map's bounding box:  **(-2.0, 0.0, 12.0, 10.0)**  Explanation: - The longitude most likely ranges from -2 degrees to about 0 degrees (since the map is likely surrounding the prime meridian and slightly to the west). - The latitude ranges from approximately 12 degrees north to 10 degrees north, relevant to the regional location in West Africa.  These coordinates best approximate the bounding box's geographic covering area indicated by this specific map section.","(-15.0, -14.0, 16.0, 15.0)"
